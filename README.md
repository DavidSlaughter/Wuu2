# Wuu2

A fun little project for learning weighted probability and using different text (.ttf) files.
The program generates a random adjective, color, and animal, for greeting someone with.

Uses classes, weighted probability (Mersenne Twister), many data types such as strings and booleans, and SFML (Standard Fast Media Library).

The program is designed to be easily modified (the individual probabilities, the chance of an adjective appearing, etc.).
The program has been ported to a window (using SFML) rather than the command prompt to make it slightly more user-friendly.
